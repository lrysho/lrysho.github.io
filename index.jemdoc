== Education
Expected to receive M.Eng. degree from the Department of Automation at Xiamen University in 2022. 
\n Received my B.Eng. degree in Automation at Xiamen University in 2019.


== Research 
Currently my research focuses on combining visual and textual features for document layout analysis which aims to recognise components on document images like title, body, tables, etc. \n
My research interests:
- Deep Learning for Computer Vision
- Machine Learning
- Digital Image Processing
- Multimodal Learning

== Project
It aims to develop an system to mark exam papers automatically, cooperated with an educational technology company in Nanjing, China.
- My main work was to detect desirable parts(e.g. student information) on paper images based on connected component analysis and the algorithm has been applied in real scenario.
- I am also responsible for coordination and communication.
